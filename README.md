# Welcome to Cythack Vulnerable Web Application!

CYTHACK is a PHP/MySQL web application that is vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and to aid both students & teachers to learn about web application security in a controlled class room environment.

The aim of CYTHACK is to practice some of the most common web vulnerabilities, with various levels of difficultly, with a simple straightforward interface.

# General Instructions 

It is up to the user how they approach CYTHACK. Either by working through every module at a fixed level, or selecting any module and working up to reach the highest level they can before moving onto the next one. There is not a fixed object to complete a module; however users should feel that they have successfully exploited the system as best as they possible could by using that particular vulnerability.

Please note, there are both documented and undocumented vulnerability with this software. This is intentional. You are encouraged to try and discover as many issues as possible.

CYTHACK also includes a Web Application Firewall (WAF), PHPIDS, which can be enabled at any stage to further increase the difficulty. This will demonstrate how adding another layer of security may block certain malicious actions. Note, there are also various public methods at bypassing these protections (so this can be seen as an extension for more advanced users)!

There is a help button at the bottom of each page, which allows you to view hints & tips for that vulnerability. There are also additional links for further background reading, which relates to that security issue.
